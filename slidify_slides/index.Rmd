## Sample Size calculation in R
* Previous Slide's Screen Shot(Default Parameters) same as below the code in R
```{r}
base_cvr <- .06; var_cvr <- base_cvr + .01 ;sig_level <- .05; pwr_level <- .8
ceiling(power.prop.test(
    p1 = base_cvr, p2 = var_cvr, sig.level = sig_level, power = pwr_level)$n)
```
